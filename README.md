# DyD-First-Campaign

Readme of this project that I Forgot to automatically create at the begining

I'll write here some objectives for now:

If the file gets too big I'll add the objectives to a separate file.

- Kinda add a character sheet for the RP
- Will add some relevant places descriptions
- Will add some relevant objects description
- Will add some online pages for references (like one for online dice throwing for example)
- Will add some rules of D&D to make the RPs feel more fun.
- Will add some abilities related to my character.
- Will add some conditions that characters can have.
- Will add some kind of file list to keep track of what everything has.
- Will add some more stuff when they come to my mind.
